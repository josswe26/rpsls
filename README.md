# RPSLS

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS) is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008.

This website is created to play this game against the computer while having fun. The game is entirely based on chance and the website is easy to navigate in order to find the rules, the game area and feedback form in case the user wants to leave any comments.
