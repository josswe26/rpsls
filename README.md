# RPSLS

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS) is an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008.

This website is created to play this game against the computer while having fun. The game is entirely based on chance and the website is easy to navigate in order to find the rules, the game area and feedback form in case the user wants to leave any comments.

### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/color-scheme.png)

The colors used in the site are white (#ffffff) for the navigation bar, slides background and some hover effects, a tone of orange (#bf834a) for closing buttons and buttons' hover effect, a tone of green (#789053) for the background and buttons, a blue color (#344b99) and a dark color (#151311) for the text.

The colors scheme is inspired on the game's main image. Each color represent this way the 5 different weapons (rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock) used in the game.

### Typography

The main font used in the site is Nunito, as suggested by Google Fonts for appropriate pairings with Odibee Sans, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Nunito is not being imported correctly. Odibee Sans is used for the headings and the logo for the gaming design it provides with Cursive as fallback.

### Wireframes
